The origins of this robot began with Andrew melding the raceline logic from 
Remi's K1999 and the framework code from Berniw's BT into a new bot, "locus",
which was designed to provide a competitive entry-level codebase for the 
annual TRB championship.

John used locus and made various modifications, then MLuc built on his work
with further enhancements.  Andrew has since then used MLuc's bot as a base,
introducing elements from his older (K1999-based) USR robot in order to 
create Hymie_2015.
